# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel very confident with the for statements. It is almost just built like a math formula.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
There was lots of struggle. Honestly I think the research and then trial by error was what really helped me, other than looking at other examples. Once I had it broken down to me like it was a formula, it made my starting point super easy. Other than that I still think I'll need some practice to apply everything we've learned.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? 
I think just practice in general will help me out alot. I plan on going through all the lessons and making practice gists to go over everything.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
My questions mainly are just the different ways of applying the for statments and what limits they have!
